##3ii: A public service application on the blockchain

###What is blockchain?
While “the blockchain” is commonly portrayed as a singular entity, it is in fact the integration of numerous technologies- P2P networks, consensus engines, hashing algorithms, security protocols, and application state structures. The blockchain has many incarnations, the most well known being Bitcoin. However, blockchain means different things to different people, and individuals and organizations have disparate ideas regarding how blockchains should be implemented and what purposes they should serve. Despite the range of opinions, many parties see value in existing and future applications of the blockchain across various industries. Blockchain technology has already made a large footprint in the financial sector with the abundance of cryptocurrencies pervading major banks and institutions while influencing how people across the world manage their personal finances. 

In theory, the blockchain provides an immutable ledger of transactions, be it financial transactions, votes, messages- which is replicated across a network of machines. Why is this significant? Well, it’s really hard for a bunch of computers that are not running on a single server system to agree on what the entries in the ledger should be if they are all trying to listen and talk to it at the same time. Think about the ridiculous hypothetical situation of a hundred-person conference call. The participants work at the same company but in different, geographically-separated departments. Each department has its own meetings where coworkers discuss projects and issues but every now and then there is a compay-wide conference call where each department updates the others on its developments. Unless there were well-defined rules about who should talk when, and those rules were carefully followed, it would be really difficult to have coherent and meaningful cross-departmental conversation. With nodes, or computers running on the blockchain, we cannot impose those rules; the point of the blockchain is that every node can talk to it at the same time and reach some consensus as to what the "meeting minutes" and what the "company position" is. This is no easy task, and tackling it requires the integration of the numerous technologies aforementioned. And we haven’t even considered the possibility where some people on the call want to misinform others, invalidate or obscure legitimate information.

Having this immutable ledger replicated across personal computers in a network is really awesome though (once we have it). The ledger can be used to verify transaction history and the values of digital assets. This is a big reason why blockchain has found a home in finance; it systemizes and ideally secures the accounting process. But blockchain technology is not limited to finance and cryptocurrencies. Blockchain can help governments, public service organizations, and their constituencies.

###Blockchain in public services
Blockchains enable synchronization of databases that, up until now, have been siloed. Furthermore, the blockchain redefines what a database is; how it is established and operated. Today, most big companies (e.g. Facebook) and governments manage their own server systems, through which they provide online services, run user applications, receive and store data. When you log onto Facebook, you are sending an HTTP request through your web browser to a Facebook server somewhere. Server operations check that your credentials are valid and then send an HTTP response back to you. You receive the response in your browser, and you can see your news feed, check your notifications nad messages.

While this explanation neglects many of the finer details, it illustrates that we do not (usually) interact directly with databases. Rather, we notify or send information to a server center, managed by some administrative entity. The server retrieves data from a database, possibly alters or performs computation on it, and sends it back to us in some fashion. This is no indictment of corporate practice; however, the point remains that a single administrative entity regulates access to, management and distribution of data. Personally, you may be happy that developers and engineers at Facebook handle these issues: a company with talented personnel that runs its own centralized server system is better able to manage and deliver services. But what if the entity managing the server system is untrustworthy or incompetent? Forget about the reputation of the administrative entity- what if you are trying to prove that a digital asset is worth X amount. This is something for which you might like confirmation from other parties (e.g. market participants), even if the administrative entity (e.g. the bank) is reputable. But even the most “reputable” institutions are capable of corruption, fraud, and the like.

City governments also have servers and databases. Of course, these systems provide different services and store different data than those managed by Facebook. Nevertheless, we have a similar plot line: an administrative entity regulates access to, management and distribution of data. In the past several years, there has been a push in many U.S. cities to collect more public data and make it available to constituencies. Even when data is collected, there isn’t always the digital infrastructure necessary to make the data easily accessible. Even when the infrastructure is in place, packaging and providing of data is an arduous process. Not to mention, it might be months or years before the government makes data from this year publicly available. 

I currently reside in the Chicagoland area. Chicago has a strong civic tech/social innovation scene and one of the better open data portals. The portal has historical data on many different things- properties, crime rates, police activity, traffic violations, etc.- which one can download or interact with through an API. While the open data portal is a wonderful resource for local officials, developers, and constituents, I believe a public service application on the blockchain- that is a database itself, is an important next step for the civic tech-scape. Ideally, constituents and local officials would use the application and interact directly with a decentralized database containing information that currently resides in city government servers. This would increase transparency, accessibility, and stakeholder-ship of public data.

###Introducing 3ii
3ii is a public service/311 application on the blockchain. Constituents, or users, submit service requests for issues in their local area, whether it be street potholes, traffic lights out, no garbage pick-up, or concerns that do not traditionally fall under the 311 umbrella yet are  (e.g. law enforcement complaints). When a constituent submits a request through the interface, the request is appended to an immutable ledger of service requests, assuming the submission form contains necessary and valid information. Each service request in the ledger has a unique ID, with which users retreive form information. In addition, users can search forms by service, address, time posted, and status (i.e. resolved or unresolved). 

Government officials, or admins, have different permissions than users. They cannot submit service requests; however, they can resolve a form after the service request has been filled. This changes the status of the form from “unresolved” to “resolved”. Wait a second, how is this different from current systems if the government officials still have administrative privileges? Managing a centralized server system, the government has the ability to manipulate data. Deleting a service request here, altering information in a citizen complaint there, though we should hope our local government doesn’t do these things. While government officials can resolve forms under the 3ii system, they should not be able to manipulate data. When an admin resolves a form, nothing about the form changes, apart from its status. A user querying the form will see that the form has been resolved by the admin at the time of resolution. If the service request has not actually been resolved  (e.g. the street light is still out), the citizen can perform his favorite civic duty: complaining! However, the government and the constituent will have a canonical chronology of events- constituent X submitted service request at 10:09 am on Tuesday, admin Y resolved form 2:35 pm on Friday, etc- to hash out the situation. 

So does 3ii just give constituents evidence to support their complaints? Citizen empowerment is one of the potential benefits. However, there are two greater motivations for a system such as this, the first of which harkens back to the concept of the open data portal. It is that public data should be a communal resource. It should be something we all interact with and help to create. While open data portals are a great resource, the concept reinforces the notion that public data is something provided by the government to the constituent. The act of provision, however, implies the providing entity regulates access to, management and distribution of data. But within the context of this discussion, this is exactly what I'm suggesting we move away from- a singular entity managing the database. It is preferable, where possible, to faciliate cooperative development of public data between citizens and officials.

One may contend, government officials have knowledge and expertise in public service and access to certain resources, thus warranting their presiding over public data. Involving constituents in the creation and collection of public data will introduce inefficiencies into the process and yield messy outputs. To that, I quote Ethan Buchman of Tendermint when I ask, "why not institute a dictatorship if we are concerned about efficiency?" Jokes aside, constituent involvement in a system like 3ii will not necessarily lead to messy data or inefficiency. How? Mitigating data mutability- the second motivation of 3ii. When a constituent submits a valid service request, the form is cached and eventually append to the ledger, after which nothing about the form besides its status can be altered. There is no administrative entity that can modify or redact form fields; admins are only authorized to resolve forms. In a sense, each valid service request submitted by a constituent that makes it into the transaction ledger is etched in stone. Why is this so important? Many current systems have extensive data mutability, which opens a pandora’s box of code bugs and higher-level issues that can manifest in one of many ways (e.g. losing personal account information or digitally held funds for X users). By reducing mutability of public data, we can hopefully prevent many of these issues. 

So constituents and local officials using the 3ii system cannot modify data. Constituents can submit service requests and search for submitted forms in real time. The former is nothing new, assuming the constituent's municipality already provides an online 311 service. The latter is. Sure, I can find historical 311 service requests in the Chicago open data portal. But my accessing the data hinges on whether/when the city government decides to provide it via the portal, and the quality of the data is contigent on the due dilligence of X number of government employees. Involving consituents in the creation and collection of public data does not equate to "letting them mess things up". Rather, we are providing an interface through which they can submit service requests (which they may already do), query submitted forms, and retreive form information in real time. We are maintaining the write permissions while expanding the read permissions of constituents. Government officials benefit too. While their actions are broadcast to users, increasing transparency and exposure, they also have the power of the blockchain and decentralized network at their fingertips. The integrity of the database and its content are validated not only by government but consituencies using the 3ii system.
