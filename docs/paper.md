##3ii: A public service application on the blockchain

####What is blockchain?
While “the blockchain” is commonly portrayed as a singular entity, it is in fact the integration of numerous technologies- P2P networks, consensus engines, hashing algorithms, security protocols, and application state structures (e.g. key-value stores, merkle trees). The blockchain has many incarnations, the most well known being Bitcoin. However, blockchain means different things to different people, and individuals and organizations have disparate ideas regarding how blockchains should be implemented and what purposes they should serve. Despite the range of opinions, many parties see value in existing and future applications of the blockchain across various industries. Blockchain technology has already made a large footprint in the financial sector with the abundance of cryptocurrencies pervading major banks and institutions while influencing how people across the world manage their personal finances. 

In theory, the blockchain provides an immutable ledger of transactions, be it financial transactions, political transactions (i.e. votes), messages- which is replicated across a network of machines. Why is this important? Well, it’s really hard for a bunch of computers that are not running on a single server system to agree on what the entries in the ledger should be if they are all trying to listen and talk to it at the same time. Think about trying to have a conference call with a hundred other people. Unless there were well-defined rules about who should talk when, and those rules were carefully followed, it would be really difficult to have a meaningful conversation. Imagining the conference call as a blockchain, we can’t impose those rules; the point of the blockchain is that everyone can talk to it at the same time and we reach some consensus as to what the meeting minutes are. This is no easy task, and tackling it requires the integration of the numerous technologies aforementioned. And we haven’t even considered the possibility that some people on the call want to misinform others, invalidate or obscure legitimate information. How will the integrity of the conference call withstand these malicious ends?

Having this immutable ledger replicated across personal computers in a network is really awesome though (once we have it). The ledger can be used to verify transaction history and the values of digital assets. This is a big reason why blockchain has found a home in finance; it systemizes and ideally secures the accounting process. But blockchain technology is not limited to finance and cryptocurrencies. Blockchain can help governments, public service organizations, and their constituencies.

If you would like to dig deeper into blockchain technology, I recommend reading about Bitcoin and checking out Ethereum. If you like blog posts, poke around Medium. I found two articles which, I believe, nicely articulate the importance of blockchains. The [first](https://medium.com/@wmougayar/explaining-the-blockchain-via-a-google-docs-analogy-56326b1bbe58#.cc31fdupy) provides a high-level discussion of blockchains with a google docs analogy; the [second](https://medium.com/@ConsenSys/programmable-blockchains-in-context-ethereum-s-future-cd8451eb421e#.n10mf920z) offers a historical overview of the internet, databases, and where blockchains fit into the schema. If you’re more of a podcast person, Epicenter Bitcoin has some great talks with leading industry professionals and academics. A lot of blockchain companies publish white papers about their technologies. These can be informative resources, though often very technical.

####Blockchain in public services
The second article I linked to emphasizes a crucial point: blockchains enable synchronization of databases that, up until now, have been siloed. Furthermore, the blockchain redefines what a database is; how it is established and operated. Today, most big companies (e.g. Facebook) and governments manage their own server systems, through which they provide online services, run user applications, receive and store data. When you log onto Facebook, you are sending an HTTP request through your web browser to a Facebook server somewhere. Server operations check that your credentials are valid and then send an HTTP response back to you. You receive the response in your browser, and you can see your news feed and check your notifications.

While this explanation neglects many of the finer details, it illustrates that we do not (usually) interact directly with databases. Rather, we notify or send information to a server center, managed by some administrative entity. The server retrieves data from a database, possibly alters or performs computation on it, and sends it back to us in some fashion. This is no indictment of corporate practice; however, we cannot dismiss the point that a single administrative entity regulates access to, management and distribution of data. Personally, you may be happy that developers and engineers at Facebook handle these issues: a company with talented personnel that runs its own centralized server system is better able to manage and deliver services. But what if the entity managing the server system is untrustworthy or incompetent? Forget about the reputation of the administrative entity- what if you are trying to prove that a digital asset is worth X amount. This is something for which you might like confirmation from other parties (e.g. multiple market participants), even if the administrative entity (e.g. the bank) is reputable. But even the most “reputable” institutions are capable of corruption, fraud, and the like.

City governments also have servers and databases. Of course, these systems provide different services and store different data than those managed by Facebook. Nevertheless, we still have the same plot line: an administrative entity regulates access to, management and distribution of data. But now we’re dealing with city governments instead of tech companies. In the past several years, there has been a push in many U.S. cities to collect more public data and make it available to constituencies. Even when data is collected, there isn’t always the digital infrastructure necessary to make the data easily accessible. Even when the infrastructure is in place, packaging and devising meaningful representations of data is no easy task. Not to mention, it might be months or years before the government makes data from this year publicly available. 

I currently reside in the Chicagoland area. Chicago has a strong civic tech/social innovation scene and one of the better open data portals. The portal has historical data on many different things- properties, crime and police activity, traffic violations, etc.- which one can download or interact with through an API. While the open data portal is a wonderful resource for local officials, developers, and constituents, I believe a public service application on the blockchain- that is a database itself, is an important next step for civic tech. Ideally, constituents and local officials would use the application and interact directly with a decentralized database containing information that currently resides in city government servers. This would increase transparency, accessibility, and stakeholder-ship of public data.

####Introducing 3ii
3ii is a public service/311 application on the blockchain. Constituents, or users, submit service requests for issues in their local area, whether it be street potholes, traffic lights out, or no garbage pick-up. When a constituent submits a request through the interface, the request is appended to an immutable ledger of service requests, assuming the submission form contains necessary and valid information. Each service request in the ledger has a unique ID, wih which users retreive form information. In addition, users can search forms by service requested, address, time posted, status (resolved or unresolved), etc. 

Admins (i.e. government officials) have user capabilities with additional permissions and privileges. Admins can resolve a form after the service request has been filled. This changes the status of the form from “unresolved” to “resolved”. Wait a second, how is this different from current systems if the government officials still have admin privileges? Managing a centralized server system, the government has the ability to manipulate data. Deleting a service request here, altering information in a citizen complaint there, though we expect and hope our local government doesn’t do those things. While government officials can resolve forms and perform other special functions under the 3ii system, they should not be able to manipulate data. When an admin resolves a form, nothing about the form changes, apart from its status. A user querying the form will see that the form has been resolved by the admin at the time of resolution. If the service request has not actually been resolved  (e.g. the street light is still out), the citizen can perform his favorite civic duty: complaining! However, the government and the constituent will have the 3ii system to hash out the chronology of events- constituent X submitted service request at 10:09 am on Tuesday, admin Y resolved form 2:35 pm on Friday, etc. 

So does 3ii just give constituents evidence to support their complaints? Yes, citizen empowerment is one of the potential benefits. However, there are two greater motivations for a system such as this, the first of which harkens back to the concept of the open data portal. It is that public data should be a communal resource. It should be something we all interact with and help to create. While open data portals are great, the concept reinforces the notion that public data is something provided by the government to the constituent. The act of provision, however, implies the providing entity regulates access to, management and distribution of data. But within the context of this discussion, this is exactly what we’re trying to move away from- a singular entity managing the database. One may contend, government officials have knowledge and expertise in public service, thus warranting their presiding over public data. Involving constituents in the creation and collection of public data will introduce inefficiencies into the process and yield messy outputs. To that, I quote Ethan Buchman of Tendermint when I ask, why not institute a dictatorship if we are concerned about efficiency? Jokes aside, constituent involvement in a system like 3ii will not necessarily lead to messy data or inefficiency. Remember, constiuents and local officials using the 3ii system cannot modify data. Constituents can submit service requests and search for submitted forms in real time. The former is nothing new, assuming the constituent's municipality already had an online 311 service. The latter is. I can find historical 311 service requests in the Chicago open data portal. But my accessing data hinges on if and when the city government decides to provide it via the portal. Involving consituents in the creation and collection of public data does not equate to "letting them mess things up". Rather, we are providing an interface through which they can submit service requests (which they may already do), query submitted forms, and retreive form information in real time. Provided that security measures are met, we are maintaining or streamlining the write permissions while expanding the read permissions of constituents.

Measured decentralization of data across a network of government officials and constituents is the first motivation. The second is data immutability, or unchangeability, the major tenet of the functional programming paradigm. When a constituent submits a valid service request, the form is broadcast to the network, appended to the transaction ledger and stored in a cache system, after which nothing about the form besides its status can be altered. There is no administrative entity that can modify or redact form fields; admins are only authorized to resolve forms. In a sense, each valid service request submitted by a constituent that makes it into the transaction ledger is etched in stone. Why is this so important? Many of the systems currently used have data mutability; we are still able to collect, send, and receive the information we want efficiently. This is true… some of the time. However, data mutability opens a pandora’s box of code bugs and higher-level issues that can manifest in one of many awful ways (e.g. losing personal account information or digitally held funds for X users ). If not already apparent, the benefit of data immutability becomes clear when data mutability bites you in the butt. By ensuring immutability, or reduced mutability of public data, we can mitigate issues stemming from data manipulation.
