1. Worth noting, city governments want robust systems.. blockchains are pretty inefficient data structures.. running a 311 system on a centralized server is a lot faster
1. City governments also like mature, enterprise-level systems.. moving onto the cloud and deploying digital services on Salesforce
1. However, this^ is expensive.. blockchain applications offer big potential cost savings
1. Tailor 3ii to a specific govt dept, community insitution, or purpose (e.g. logging citizen complaints against law enforcement. Big issue in Chicago historically, with complaints being lost, destroyed, redacted.. Also arduous process of submitting a complaint)
1. Rebrand as comit (with a comet logo)
1. This is close to commit (i.e. "commiting" a block of transactions to a blockchain)
1. What's the meaning of this? Well, every valid citizen complaint (valid meaning containing requisite and pertinent information re the complaint issue) is "committed" to a decentralized database. Once there, it cannot be deleted, mutated, redacted, etc. Enabling constituents to commit their complaints embodies a larger public service commitment to the community
1. What role does govt/the administrative organization play? The admin does not manage the database/cannot mutate data; they run the application server and validator nodes to secure the network
1. Essentially, the govt runs machines to ensure security of what is in theory a trustless system
1. Transparency: constituents and officials can query complaints
1. Better word than complaint? Issue, incident? 
1. Censorship resistance = big selling point of blockchains.. target use cases where there is controversy over the administrative entity restricing access/distribution of information 
1. Comit is not a messaging app. However, limited messaging functionality may help admins connect with constituents and work to resolve issues, especially went the issues involve sensitive or serious subject matter.
